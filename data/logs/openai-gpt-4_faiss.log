Question: What's PCI DSS?
{'question': "What's PCI DSS?", 'chat_history': []}
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect payment data. It includes requirements for building and maintaining a secure network, protecting account data, maintaining a vulnerability management program, and implementing strong access control measures. It is used by entities involved in payment card processing to protect against cyber attacks and ensure the security of the payment industry.

What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

The new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing include:

1. Internal penetration testing should be performed per the entity’s defined methodology, at least once every 12 months, after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or change, and by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third-party.

2. The penetration testing methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.

3. There is a new requirement to maintain an inventory of bespoke and custom software. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.

4. There is a new requirement to deploy an automated technical solution for public-facing web applications that separate providers’ environments and customers’ environments. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.

5. There is a new requirement to confirm, via penetration testing, the effectiveness of logical separation controls used to separate customer environments. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.

6. There is a new requirement for the implementation of processes and mechanisms for reporting and addressing suspected or confirmed security incidents and vulnerabilities. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.

7. The applicable security patches to be installed within one month of release have been changed from “critical security patches” to “critical or high-security patches/updates.”

8. The requirement for addressing new threats and vulnerabilities for public-facing web applications has been moved under Requirement 6.4.

9. The term “compromise” has been replaced with “suspected or confirmed security incident” in A1.2.2.

10. The results of penetration testing and remediation activities should be retained for at least 12 months.

The penetration testing methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.\n\n3. There is a new requirement to maintain an inventory of bespoke and custom software. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.\n\n4. There is a new requirement to deploy an automated technical solution for public-facing web applications that separate providers’ environments and customers’ environments. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.\n\n5. There is a new requirement to confirm, via penetration testing, the effectiveness of logical separation controls used to separate customer environments. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.\n\n6. There is a new requirement for the implementation of processes and mechanisms for reporting and addressing suspected or confirmed security incidents and vulnerabilities. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.\n\n7. The applicable security patches to be installed within one month of release have been changed from “critical security patches” to “critical or high-security patches/updates.”\n\n8. The requirement for addressing new threats and vulnerabilities for public-facing web applications has been moved under Requirement 6.4.\n\n9. The term “compromise” has been replaced with “suspected or confirmed security incident” in A1.2.2.\n\n10. The results of penetration testing and remediation activities should be retained for at least 12 months.')]}

Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

The process typically includes the following steps:
- Testing from both inside and outside the network to simulate attacks from an insider and an external threat.
- Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls.
- Application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4.
- Network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.
- Review and consideration of threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the last 12 months.
- A documented approach to assessing and addressing the risk posed by exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses found during penetration testing.

Penetration testing is performed per the entity’s defined methodology, at least once every 12 months, and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or change. It can be performed by a qualified internal resource or a qualified external third-party. The tester should have organizational independence, meaning they should not be influenced by the organization that is being tested. The results of the penetration testing and remediation activities should be retained for at least 12 months.
