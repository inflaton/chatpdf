Question: What's PCI DSS?
{'question': "What's PCI DSS?", 'chat_history': []}
 PCI DSS is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements 
designed to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard. PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed. PCI DSS v4.0 will be phased out in 
2023.
