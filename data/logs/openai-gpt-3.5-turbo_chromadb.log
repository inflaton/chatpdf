Question: What's PCI DSS?
{'question': "What's PCI DSS?", 'chat_history': []}
PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a global standard that provides a set of requirements and security controls designed to protect payment card data. The standard outlines measures that organizations must implement to build and maintain a secure network, protect account data, maintain a vulnerability management program, and implement strong access control measures. Compliance with PCI DSS is required for any organization that handles payment card data.

What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the

What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0?

In PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several changes and additions to the requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Here are the key changes:

1. Requirement 11.4.1: A penetration testing methodology is defined, documented, and implemented by the entity. This methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components supporting network functions and operating systems.

2. Requirement 6.2.4: The requirements for addressing common coding vulnerabilities have been moved from 6.5.1-6.5.10 to align all software development content under Requirement 6.2. This change combines methods to prevent or mitigate common software attacks into a single requirement and generalizes the language describing each type of attack.

3. Requirement 6.3: The requirements for identifying security vulnerabilities and protecting system components from vulnerabilities via patching have been moved under Requirement 6.3. This change reorganizes the structure and format of the requirements.

4. Requirement 6.3.1: A bullet has been added to clarify the applicability of vulnerabilities to bespoke and custom third-party software.

5. Requirement 6.3.2: A new requirement has been added to maintain an inventory of bespoke and custom software.

Please note that these changes are based on the information provided and may not include all the updates in PCI DSS version 4.0. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to refer to the official PCI DSS documentation.
