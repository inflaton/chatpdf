information, which does not replace or supersede PCI SSC Security Standards or their supporting documents.
December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

  PCI DSS compliance requires organizations to implement various measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data such as credit card numbers, personal identification numbers (PIN), and other financial transaction data. This includes implementing strong access control mechanisms, restricting physical access to cardholder data, monitoring and testing networks and systems, maintaining information security policies, and supporting qualified personnel through training programs. By adhering to these standards, organizations can reduce their exposure to potential cyber attacks and improve overall security posture.

 The organization should define their own methodology for determining which vulnerabilities need to be addressed during a vulnerability assessment or penetration test. This may include reviewing past incidents, analyzing threat intelligence reports, conducting regular vulnerability scans, and consulting with subject matter experts. It's important to prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities and ensure they are being addressed promptly and effectively.
