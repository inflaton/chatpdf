Question: What's PCI DSS?
Answer:   PCI   DSS   is   a   global   standard   that   provides   a   baseline   of   technical   and   operational   requirements   designed   to   protect   payment   data. 

Both `max_new_tokens` (=2048) and `max_length`(=20) seem to have been set. `max_new_tokens` will take precedence. Please refer to the documentation for more information. (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation)

 1. New requirement for roles and responsibilities. 
 2. New requirement bullet to confirm certificates used for PAN transmissions over open, public networks are valid and not expired or revoked. 
 3. New requirement to maintain an inventory of trusted keys and certifiicates. 
 4. New requirement to define, document, and implement a penetration testing methodology that includes industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.

Question: more on penetration testing
  What   are   the   new   requirements   for   penetration   testing   in   PCI   DSS   version   4.0? 

Both `max_new_tokens` (=2048) and `max_length`(=20) seem to have been set. `max_new_tokens` will take precedence. Please refer to the documentation for more information. (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/text_generation)

***Answer:
I don't see any new requirements for penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0. The only change in the summary of changes is that the overview sections and overview sections have been reformatted and added guidance at the start of each principal requirement. The requirements and testing procedures have also been renumbered and reorganized due to the addition of numbered requirement description headings. The directive requirements have been rephrased to be objective.
