What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

 Summary of Changes to PCI DSS Introductory Sections  - summarizes  changes made for 
each affected section.  
 Summary of General Changes to PCI DSS Requirements  - summarizes  changes made 
throughout the requirements, testing procedures, and guidance.  
 Additional Changes per Requirement  - summarizes  additional changes made in 
requirements 1- 12 and the appendices.

***Answer:
New requirements for penetration testing in PCI DSS v4.0 include: 
 * A requirement to define, document, and implement a penetration testing methodology that includes industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.

Requirement Description  
11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.  
PCI DSS Requirement  
11.4.1 A penetration testing methodology is defined, documented, and implemented by the entity and includes:  
• Industry -accepted penetration testing approaches.  
• Coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.  
• Testing from both inside and outside the network.  
• Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls.  
• Application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4.  
• Network -layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.
