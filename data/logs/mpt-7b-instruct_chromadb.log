Requirement Description  
11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.  
PCI DSS Requirement  
11.4.1 A penetration testing methodology is defined, documented, and implemented by the entity and includes:  
• Industry -accepted penetration testing approaches.  
• Coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.  
• Testing from both inside and outside the network.  
• Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls.  
• Application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4.  
• Network -layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.
