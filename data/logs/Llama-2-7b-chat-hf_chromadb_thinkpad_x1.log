What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0?



on_llm_end - response:
generations=[[Generation(text=' What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0?', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None run=None
In PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. These include:


Requirement 11.2: Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing - This requirement outlines the need for organizations to conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential security risks. The frequency of these tests will depend on the size of the organization and the level of risk associated with its environment.
Requirement 11.3: Network Segmentation - This requirement emphasizes the importance of segmenting a cardholder data environment (CDE) into smaller subnets or segments to reduce the attack surface and limit the spread of a security breach.
Requirement 11.4: Wireless Security - This requirement highlights the need for organizations to implement strong wireless security measures, such as encryption and authentication, to protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data via Wi-Fi networks.
Requirement 11.5: Third Party Service Providers - This requirement requires organizations to perform due diligence on third party service providers that have access to cardholder data to ensure they are compliant with PCI DSS standards.
Requirement 11.6: Incident Response Plan - This requirement outlines the need for organizations to develop and maintain an incident response plan that can be used in the event of a security breach. The plan should outline procedures for containing and mitigating the breach, as well as notifying affected parties.
