December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

 In PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several new requirements related to vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. These include:
* A new requirement (6.5.10) for conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify potential security weaknesses in the environment.
* An updated requirement (6.2.4) for addressing common coding vulnerabilities in software development content.
* A new bullet point (6.3.1) for clarifying the applicability of vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to bespoke and custom software.
* A new requirement (6.3.2) for maintaining an inventory of bespoke and custom software.
These changes aim to improve the overall security posture of organizations by proactively identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

What are some of the key aspects of penetration testing that organizations should consider when implementing PCI DSS version 4.0?

generations=[[Generation(text=' What are some of the key aspects of penetration testing that organizations should consider when implementing PCI DSS version 4.0?', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None run=None
 Based on the provided excerpts from the PCI DSS v4.0 ROC Template, here are some key aspects of penetration testing that organizations should consider when implementing PCI DSS version 4.0:
1. Regular external penetration testing: Organizations must conduct regular external penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their network perimeter and critical systems. This testing should be conducted at least once every 12 months and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or change.
2. Methodology definition and documentation: Organizations must define and document their penetration testing methodology to ensure consistency and repeatability of the testing process. This methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches and cover the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.
3. Testing from inside and outside the network: Penetration testing should be conducted from both inside and outside the network to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited from either perspective.
4. Segmentation and scope-reduction control testing: Penetration testing should also validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls implemented by the organization.
5. Application-layer penetration testing: Organizations must conduct application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in their applications, including those listed in Requirement 6.2.4.
6. Network-layer penetration testing: Network-layer penetration testing should encompass all components that support network functions, including operating systems, and identify potential vulnerabilities in these components.
7. Evidence reporting and correction of vulnerabilities: After conducting penetration testing, organizations must report on the findings and correct any identified vulnerabilities in accordance with their defined methodology and risk assessment.
By considering these key aspects of penetration testing, organizations can demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS version 4.0 and improve their overall security posture.
