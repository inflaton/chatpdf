December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the

payment account data used by payment cards and related electronic payment systems.
As a payment system stakeholder, your company is on the front line of a high-stakes battle for keeping 
payment data safe from theft and exploitation. Occasional lax security enables criminals to easily steal and 
use personal consumer financial information from payment transactions and processing systems.
Vulnerabilities may appear anywhere in the card-processing ecosystem, including but not limited to:
• point-of-sale devices;
• cloud-based systems;
• mobile devices, personal computers, or servers;
• wireless hotspots;
• web shopping applications;
• paper-based storage systems;
• the transmission of cardholder data to service providers;
• remote access connections.
Vulnerabilities may also extend to systems operated by service providers and acquirers, which are the 
financial institutions that initiate and maintain the relationships with merchants that accept payment cards 
(see diagram on page 5).

on_llm_end - response:
generations=[[Generation(text=' How can businesses assess their risk exposure to cyber attacks and vulnerabilities?', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None run=None
 Businesses should conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify potential threats and weaknesses within their IT infrastructure. This includes assessing the risks associated with employees accessing sensitive data, as well as identifying any external sources of attack such as phishing scams or social engineering tactics. It's important to have clear guidelines and procedures in place for responding to these types of incidents, along with appropriate training for employees who handle sensitive data. Additionally, businesses should implement strong access controls and encryption measures to protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data. Regular testing and monitoring of systems and networks also helps to ensure that they remain protected against known vulnerabilities and new threats.
