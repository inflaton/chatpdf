December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

1. Use industry-accepted penetration testing approaches and methodologies.
2. Test the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, including network, application, and social engineering attacks.
3. Perform testing from both inside and outside the network to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
4. Validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls to ensure they are effective.
5. Conduct regular penetration testing, at least annually, and after any significant changes to the CDE.
6. Use qualified internal resources or qualified external third-party testers who maintain organizational independence.
7. Document all findings and corrective actions taken to address vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.
8. Repeat penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of corrections made.
9. Use a customized approach when necessary, but document the aspects of the requirement where the customized approach was used.
10. Implement compensating controls when necessary, and document their use in Appendix C.
