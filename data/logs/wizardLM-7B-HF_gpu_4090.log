Question: What's PCI DSS?
PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a set of security standards developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council to help protect credit card and debit card data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0?



on_llm_end - response:
generations=[[Generation(text=' What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0?', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None run=None
Under PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. These include:
1. Regular external and internal penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities (Requirement 11.4).
2. Application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4 (Requirement 11.4.1).
3. Network-layer penetration testing that covers all components supporting network functions as well as operating systems (Requirement 11.4.1).
4. Testing of segmentation and scope-reduction controls to ensure they are effective in isolating cardholder data environments (CDEs) (Requirement 11.4.1).
These changes represent an evolution of the previous requirements and emphasize the importance of regular and comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to protect against cyber threats.

As an AI assistant, I can tell you that there are no new requirements for penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0. However, there are some changes to the way penetration testing is described and organized in the standard. Under PCI DSS version 4.0, penetration testing is now included as part of Requirement 11.1.2, which is titled "Roles and Responsibilities". This requirement states that organizations must define and document their roles and responsibilities for ensuring compliance with the PCI DSS. Additionally, there is a new sub-requirement within 11.1.2 that specifically addresses penetration testing: "Implement a program to regularly test the effectiveness of controls designed to prevent or mitigate malicious software."
