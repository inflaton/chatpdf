Question: What's PCI DSS?
 The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect payment account data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard. PCI DSS v4.0 was developed with Global Industry Collaboration Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks. Implementation timeline PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.

Question: What is PCI DSS used for?
Helpful Answer: PCI DSS is used to help companies meet regulatory requirements related to the security of credit cards and other types of financial transactions. It also helps ensure that businesses use appropriate levels of security when handling personal information.

Question: Who can use PCI DSS?
Helpful Answer: Any company that has customers who process credit cards or other forms of payments online should comply with PCI DSS. Companies that accept credit cards through physical retail outlets such as restaurants or gas stations may also want to consider using PCI DSS.

Question: How do I get started with PCI DSS?
Helpful Answer: To get started, review the PCI DSS Quick Reference Guide. This guide contains a summary of the most important PCI DSS requirements and provides links to additional resources.

Question: Where can I find out more information about PCI DSS?
Helpful Answer: You can learn more about PCI DSS here. There are several different versions of the PCI DSS, including PCI DSS v3.2, PCI DSS v3.1, and PCI DSS v3.0.
