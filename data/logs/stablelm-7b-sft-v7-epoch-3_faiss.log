What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the

Scope of PCI DSS Requirements
PCI DSS requirements apply to:
• The cardholder data environment (CDE), which is comprised of:
 –System components, people, and processes that store, process, and transmit cardholder data and/or 
sensitive authentication data, and,
 –System components that may not store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD but have unrestricted 
connectivity to system components that store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD.
AND
• System components, people, and processes that could impact the security of the CDE.
“System components” include network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, cloud 
components, and software. See PCI DSS “Scope of PCI DSS Requirements” section for examples of 
“system components.”
Annual PCI DSS Scope Confirmation 
The first step in preparing for a PCI DSS assessment is for the assessed entity to accurately determine 
the scope of the review. The assessed entity must confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope according

systems that are connected to or, if compromised, could impact the CDE (for example, authentication 
servers, remote access servers, logging servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope. All 
systems and locations should be considered during the scoping process, including backup/recovery sites 
and fail-over systems.ANNUAL CONFIRMATION OF 
PCI DSS SCOPE
The annual confirmation of PCI DSS 
scope is defined at PCI DSS 
Requirement 12.5.2 and is expected 
to be performed by the entity. This 
activity is not the same as, nor is 
it intended to be replaced by, the 
scoping confirmation performed 
by the entity’s assessor during the 
assessment.

12.5.2.b Examine documented results 
of scope reviews performed by the 
entity to verify that PCI DSS scoping 
confirmation activity includes all 
elements specified in this 
requirement.  Identify the evidence reference number(s) 
from Section 6  for all documented results 
of scope reviews examined for this 
testing procedure.  <Enter Response Here>  
PCI DSS Requirement  
12.5.2.1 Additional requirement for service providers only:  PCI DSS scope is documented and confirmed by the entity at least once every six months and 
upon significant change to t he in -scope environment. At a minimum, the scoping validation includes all the elements specified in Requirement 12.5.2.  
Note:  This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.
