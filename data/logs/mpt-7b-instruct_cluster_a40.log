Why it is important: Security practices must evolve as threats change.
Examples:
• Expanded multi-factor authentication requirements. 
• Updated password requirements.
• New e-commerce and phishing requirements to address ongoing threats.
Promote security as a continuous process.
Why it is important: Criminals never sleep. Ongoing security is crucial to
