What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

1. Expansion of the card data environment (CDE) to include all systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data, regardless of whether they are owned by the organization or a third party.
2. Increased focus on vulnerability management, including regular security assessments and penetration testing.
3. Clarified requirements around access control, including stronger authentication methods for remote access and multi-factor authentication for critical systems.
4. Updated requirements around network segmentation and firewalls, including the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) for remote workers.
5. Stronger requirements around incident response planning and disaster recovery, including the creation of a formal Incident Response Plan (IRP).
These changes are intended to help organizations better protect against cyber threats and reduce the risk of data breaches.

Under PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. These include:
1. Regular external and internal penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities (Requirement 11.4).
2. Application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4 (Requirement 11.4.1).
3. Network-layer penetration testing that covers all components supporting network functions as well as operating systems (Requirement 11.4.1).
4. Testing of segmentation and scope-reduction controls to ensure they are effective in isolating cardholder data environments (CDEs) (Requirement 11.4.1).
These changes represent an evolution of the previous requirements and emphasize the importance of regular and comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to protect against cyber threats.
