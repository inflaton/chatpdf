The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect payment data. It includes requirements for building and maintaining a secure network and systems, protecting account data, maintaining a vulnerability management program, and implementing strong access control measures.

What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the

The new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing include:

1. Internal penetration testing should be performed per the entity’s defined methodology, at least once every 12 months, after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or change, and by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third-party.

2. The penetration testing methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.

3. There is a new requirement to maintain an inventory of bespoke and custom software. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.

4. There is a new requirement to confirm, via penetration testing, the effectiveness of logical separation controls used to separate customer environments. This requirement is also a best practice until 31 March 2025.

5. There is a new requirement for the implementation of processes and mechanisms for reporting and addressing suspected or confirmed security incidents and vulnerabilities. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025.

6. The applicable security patches to be installed within one month of release have been changed from “critical security patches” to “critical or high-security patches/updates.”

7. There is a new requirement to deploy an automated technical solution for public-facing web applications. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025. 

8. The results of penetration testing and remediation activities should be retained for at least 12 months.

Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

The process typically includes the following steps:
1. Planning and reconnaissance: Defining the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used. Then gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail servers) to better understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities.
2. Scanning: The next step is to understand how the target application will respond to various intrusion attempts. This is typically done using static analysis (inspecting an app’s code) and dynamic analysis (inspecting an app’s code in a running state).
3. Gaining Access: This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target's vulnerabilities. Testers then try to exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause.
4. Maintaining access: The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system—long enough for a bad actor to gain in-depth access. The idea is to imitate advanced persistent threats, which often remain in a system for months in order to steal an organization’s most sensitive data.
5. Analysis: The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report detailing:
   - Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited
   - Sensitive data that was accessed
   - The amount of time the tester was able to remain in the system undetected

This information is used to help network administrators and IT personnel secure the network and prevent future attacks. It's recommended to perform penetration testing regularly and also after any significant changes in the network or applications.
