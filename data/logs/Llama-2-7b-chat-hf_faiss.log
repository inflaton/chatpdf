December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0 compared to previous versions?



on_llm_end - response:
generations=[[Generation(text=' What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0 compared to previous versions?', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None run=None
 In PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several new requirements related to vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. These include:

* Requirement 4.1.2: Conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses in the network and systems that handle cardholder data.
* Requirement 4.2.1.1: Perform quarterly vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify any potential weaknesses in the network and systems that handle cardholder data.
* Requirement 4.2.1.2: Document the results of vulnerability scans and penetration tests, including any identified weaknesses and the actions taken to remediate them.
* Requirement 4.2.1.3: Review and update the vulnerability management program regularly to ensure it remains current and effective.
It is important to note that these new requirements may have different implementation schedules depending on the size and complexity of the organization's environment. It is recommended to consult the official PCI DSS documentation for more detailed information on these requirements and their associated timelines.

Penetration testing involves various techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's systems and networks. Some common techniques used in penetration testing include:
Network Scanning: This technique involves identifying open ports, services, and IP addresses on a target network using tools such as Nmap or Nessus.
Vulnerability Scanning: This technique involves identifying potential vulnerabilities in a target system or network using tools such as OpenVAS or Qualys.
Wireless Network Testing: This technique involves identifying weaknesses in a wireless network, including poor encryption, misconfigured access points, and rogue devices.
Web Application Testing: This technique involves identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and input validation weaknesses.
Social Engineering: This technique involves simulating attacks on an organization's employees to test their susceptibility to phishing, pretexting, and other types of social engineering attacks.
Physical Security Testing: This technique involves assessing the physical security of an organization's premises, including locks, fences, and other security measures.
