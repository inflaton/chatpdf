December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0?



on_llm_end - response:
generations=[[Generation(text=' What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0?', generation_info=None)]] llm_output=None run=None
Under PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. These include:
1. Regular external and internal penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities (Requirement 11.4).
2. Application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4 (Requirement 11.4.1).
3. Network-layer penetration testing that covers all components supporting network functions as well as operating systems (Requirement 11.4.1).
4. Testing of segmentation and scope-reduction controls to ensure they are effective in isolating cardholder data environments (CDEs) (Requirement 11.4.1).
These changes represent an evolution of the previous requirements and emphasize the importance of regular and comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to protect against cyber threats.
