Question: What's PCI DSS?
{'question': "What's PCI DSS?", 'chat_history': []}
PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a global standard that outlines the technical and operational requirements for protecting payment card data. The standard provides guidelines and security controls to help organizations maintain a secure network, protect account data, and implement strong access control measures. Compliance with PCI DSS is required for any organization that processes, stores, or transmits payment card data.

December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

What are the new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0?

In PCI DSS version 4.0, there are several changes and additions to the requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Here are the key changes:

1. Requirement 11.4.1: A penetration testing methodology is defined, documented, and implemented by the entity. This methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components supporting network functions and operating systems.

2. Requirement 6.2.4: The requirements for addressing common coding vulnerabilities have been moved to align all software development content under Requirement 6.2. This change combines methods to prevent or mitigate common software attacks into a single requirement and generalizes the language describing each type of attack.

3. Requirement 6.3: The requirements for identifying security vulnerabilities and protecting system components from vulnerabilities via patching have been moved under Requirement 6.3. This change helps to organize and clarify the requirements related to vulnerability management.

4. Requirement 6.3.1: A bullet has been added to clarify the applicability of vulnerabilities to bespoke and custom third-party software.

5. Requirement 6.3.2: A new requirement has been added to maintain an inventory of bespoke and custom software.

Please note that these changes are based on the provided context and may not include all the changes in PCI DSS version 4.0 related to vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to refer to the official PCI DSS version 4.0 documentation.

The key changes to the requirements for penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0 are as follows:

1. Requirement 11.4.1: A penetration testing methodology is defined, documented, and implemented by the entity. The methodology should include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, testing from both inside and outside the network, testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls, application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, and network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components supporting network functions and operating systems.

These changes emphasize the need for a well-defined and documented penetration testing methodology that covers all critical systems and network components. The testing should validate the effectiveness of segmentation and scope-reduction controls and identify vulnerabilities at both the application and network layers.

Please note that this information is based on the provided context and may not include all the changes related to penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to review the entire PCI DSS version 4.0 document.
