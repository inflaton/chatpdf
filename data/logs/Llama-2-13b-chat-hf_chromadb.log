December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the

 Based on the provided context, here are some best practices for conducting penetration testing in accordance with PCI DSS version 4.0:

1. Define a comprehensive penetration testing methodology that covers the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems, including industry-accepted penetration testing approaches and testing from both inside and outside the network.
2. Ensure that the penetration testing methodology includes application-layer penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4, as well as network-layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions and operating systems.
3. Perform regular external and internal penetration testing to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses, and correct them according to the entity's assessment of the risk posed by the security issue as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.
4. Use qualified internal resources or qualified external third-party testers who have organizational independence to perform the penetration testing.
5. Document the scope of work and results from the most recent external penetration test, and provide evidence of the testing procedures and results to demonstrate compliance with Requirement 11.4.3.
6. Conduct interviews with personnel to verify that the external penetration test was performed by a qualified resource and that organizational independence of the tester exists.
7. Use industry-accepted tools and techniques to perform the penetration testing, and document the findings and recommendations for remediation.
8. Repeat the penetration testing to verify the corrections of exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses found during the initial testing.

3. Perform regular external and internal penetration testing to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses, and correct them according to the entity's assessment of the risk posed by the security issue as defined in Requirement 6.3.1.
4. Use qualified internal resources or qualified external third-party testers who have organizational independence to perform the penetration testing.
5. Document the scope of work and results from the most recent external penetration test, and provide evidence of the testing procedures and results to demonstrate compliance with Requirement 11.4.3.
6. Conduct interviews with personnel to verify that the external penetration test was performed by a qualified resource and that organizational independence of the tester exists.
7. Use industry-accepted tools and techniques to perform the penetration testing, and document the findings and recommendations for remediation.
8. Repeat the penetration testing to verify the corrections of exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses found during the initial testing.

Requirement Description  
11.4 External and internal penetration testing is regularly performed, and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses are corrected.  
PCI DSS Requirement  
11.4.1 A penetration testing methodology is defined, documented, and implemented by the entity and includes:  
• Industry -accepted penetration testing approaches.  
• Coverage for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems.  
• Testing from both inside and outside the network.  
• Testing to validate any segmentation and scope-reduction controls.  
• Application-layer penetration testing to identify, at a minimum, the vulnerabilities listed in Requirement 6.2.4.  
• Network -layer penetration tests that encompass all components that support network functions as well as operating systems.
