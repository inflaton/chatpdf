You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This means that tokens that come after special tokens will not be properly handled. We recommend you to read the related pull request available at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565, and set the legacy attribute accordingly.

December 20221
What is the PCI Data Security Standard?
The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard that provides a baseline of technical and operational 
requirements designated to protect payment data. PCI DSS v4.0 is the next evolution of the standard.PCI DSS v4.0
Developed with Global Industry Collaboration
Development of PCI DSS v4.0 was driven by industry feedback. This version furthers the protection of payment data 
with new controls to address sophisticated cyber attacks.
Implementation Timeline
PCI DSS v3.2.1 will remain active for two years after v4.0 is published. This provides organizations time to become 
familiar with the new version, and plan for and implement the changes needed.Continue to Meet the 
Security Needs of the 
Payment Industry

There are no new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0. However, there are changes to existing requirements related to these activities. For example, external and internal penetration testing should be regularly performed (as per requirement 11.4) and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses should be corrected (per requirement 11.4.1). Additionally, a penetration testing methodology should be defined, documented, and implemented by the entity (per requirement 11.4.1), and coverage should be provided for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems (per requirement 11.4.1).
