There are no new requirements for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing under PCI DSS version 4.0. However, there are changes to existing requirements related to these activities. For example, external and internal penetration testing should be regularly performed (as per requirement 11.4) and exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses should be corrected (per requirement 11.4.1). Additionally, a penetration testing methodology should be defined, documented, and implemented by the entity (per requirement 11.4.1), and coverage should be provided for the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems (per requirement 11.4.1).
